"White-winged Grasshopper","Arthropods","Dissosteira spurcata","British Columbia, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",NA,"This grasshopper is associated with arid shrub-steppe in the intermountain west. It reaches its northern limit in the southern Okanagan Valley. Within its Canadian range, it is highly localized and has been recently recorded at only two sites. One is a Haynes Lease Wildlife Area at the north end of Osoyoos Lake and the other is a parcel of crown land on the west side of Osoyoos. While the wildlife area is secure, the crown land is under pressure for annexation and development by the town of Osoyoos. It is currently used for off-road driving and hiking. The species could also occur on the east side of Osoyoos Lake on the Osoyoos Indian Reserve. This would not greatly change the status of the species.","2019 (1) species",2019,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"

One of the eight subspecies that occur in Canada, Streaked Horned Lark, was assessed by COSEWIC as Endangered in 2003 and 2018; the other seven are considered here. Horned Lark subspecies differ in range, body size and colouration. Most subspecies have populations estimated at >1 million mature individuals in Canada, but Pallid Horned Lark and Dusky Horned Lark may have only 15,000 to 20,000 mature individuals each. Overall, the Canadian population of Horned Lark is estimated to be about 28 million mature individuals. After apparent increases in the late 1800s, most populations have declined continuously since the 1940s, with loss of marginal agricultural areas and intensification of agriculture in breeding areas, and loss of native grassland habitat negatively affecting populations on both breeding and wintering grounds. Population estimates and trends are difficult to determine for individual subspecies, and appear to vary substantially. However, at the national level, Breeding Bird Survey data for Horned Lark show a long-term (1970-2018) decline of 89% (95% credible interval: -91%, -86%), corresponding to a trend of -4.4% per year (-4.9%, -4.0%), with a short-term (2008-2018) decline of -58% (-64%, -52%), corresponding to an annual trend of -8.4% (-9.7%, -7.0%).","2020 (7) species",2020,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Marbled Godwit","Birds","Limosa fedoa","Alberta, British Columbia, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Manitoba, Ontario, Parks Canada Agency, Quebec, Saskatchewan",2023,"The Marbled Godwit is a large shorebird that nests in three disjunct areas; by far the largest population in the grasslands and parklands of the northern Great Plains (~170,000 mature individuals, 60% of which are in Canada), with two small, disjunct nesting populations in Alaska and James Bay (~2,000 mature individuals each). Data from the Breeding Bird Survey for the well-monitored midcontinent population indicate a decline of 42% over the past three generations, with the annual rate of decline accelerating to -4.5% over the past decade. Threats underlying this decline are not well known, although the rapid pace of grassland loss, as well as wetland drainage, are likely key factors. Threats on migration and in overwintering areas include the loss of wetland habitat, collisions with power lines and other infrastructure, human disturbance, contamination (including oil spills), climate-change and sea-level rise.","2021 (5) species",2021,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Rufous Hummingbird","Birds","Selasphorus rufus","Alberta, British Columbia, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency, Yukon Territory",2023,"Rufous Hummingbird remains common throughout its range, with a Canadian population estimate of 12 million mature individuals, comprising 54% of the global total. However, it has experienced a long-term population decline, which has been accelerating recently, with an estimated loss of 31% of the Canadian population between 2009 and 2019. Although causes of the decline remain only partly understood, recent research indicates that pesticides and habitat degradation associated with climate change are increasing threats. As a long-distance migrant, Rufous Hummingbird requires high-quality habitat across multiple areas for breeding, migratory stopovers, and wintering. Consequently, threats are repeatedly encountered over their annual life cycle, increasing their cumulative impact on populations.","2021 (5) species",2021,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Chinook Salmon","Marine fishes","Oncorhynchus tshawytscha","Arctic Ocean, British Columbia, Canadian Wildlife Service, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Northwest Territories, Parks Canada Agency, Pacific Ocean, Yukon Territory",2018,"These DUs are in the Skeena and Nass River drainage areas. They are an anadromous species that migrate to sea and return to spawn in natal rivers. Preliminary Predictions based on current data are as follows: Four of the DUs with complete data are ENDANGERED and the fifth is THREATENED. DUs with incomplete data are all ENDANGERED. Two DUs are data deficient. Major threats may exist and vary according to the diversity of habitat used over the Chinook salmon life cycle: (1) Estuary and (2) Coastal areas are subject to possible threats, for example, from pollution, fisheries, and pinniped predation; (3) High Seas area are subject to possible threats, for example, from competition with other salmon species and changes in ocean productivity and (4) Freshwater habitats are exposed to threats within watershed areas, for example, from habitat degradation, dams, and landslides. Skeena Chinook are a high priority species because DUs has been defined, estimated declines are large, and data are readily available, though likely requires some review. It is also in the same geographic region as Skeena Sockeye which are also subject to similar declines, data availability, and threats.","2022 (7) species",2022,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Indra Swallowtail subspecies","Arthropods","Papilio indra indra","British Columbia, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",NA,"The Indra Swallowtail is a large, striking butterfly that is restricted in Canada to the Cascade Mountains of southern British Columbia; they are known at present from only three sites. The larvae feed on the foliage of biscuitroots and perhaps other members of the carrot family that grow on sunny, south facing subalpine slopes. The species' extremely small range makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as wildfires, which are predicted to increase in size and intensity with climate change. The warming climate may also cause some loss of open subalpine meadows through an increase in tree and shrub cover.","2022 (7) species",2022,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Mouse Ears","Lichens","Erioderma sorediatum","British Columbia, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",NA,"Mouse Ears is a rare cyanolichens restricted to coastal forests. In British Columbia, it is found in four subpopulations in 5-10 locations. However some of the occurrences have not been visited for several decades. The small number of locations and the very low density of thalli found at these locations despite substantial search efforts over the last few decades suggest that this species is very rare in coastal British Columbia and could be getting rarer due to threats. In addition, this species lives on ephemeral habitats and are subject to significant threats such as logging, climate warming (heat dome of 2021), and cabin development and other anthropogenic activities along the coast-line. As a result of this information it is recommended that Erioderma sorediatum be seriously considered for an official priority status assessment.","2022 (7) species",2022,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"

They are an anadromous species that migrate to sea and return to spawn in natal rivers. Nass-Skeena Sockeye are a high priority species because populations have been defined, and observed declines coupled with small population numbers indicate considerable extinction risk. They are also in the same geographic region as Skeena Chinook which are also subject to similar declines, data availability, and threats.

"Western Spotted Skunk","Terrestrial mammals","Spilogale gracilis","British Columbia, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",2022,"Western Spotted Skunk in Canada is only found in the southwestern corner of British Columbia. The species is thought to be a habitat generalist, but in BC is found predominantly across deciduous and coniferous forest, riparian areas, and agricultural lands. Although the species is historically rare in Canada, anecdotal fur-trapping records suggest that the species was more common in southwestern BC during the 1950s and 1960s. A number of recent camera-trap studies from across the historical distribution in Canada suggest that the species is now very rare, being found only infrequently. The major threat is habitat loss associated with residential development. Trapping and road mortality could be continuing threats.","2022 (7) species",2022,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
"Giant Candlewax","Lichens","Ricasolia amplissima subsp. sheiyi","British Columbia, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",NA,"Giant Candlewax Lichen is a large tree-dwelling lichen that forms a symbiosis with both algae and cyanobacteria. It forms large thalli up to a half metre in diameter that are bright white when dry and green when wet. Giant Candlewax Lichen is found disjunct in Europe and western North America. The western North American population is genetically distinct and has been named as an endemic subspecies; the Canadian lichens belong to this subspecies. Giant Candlewax Lichen grows on highly exposed, light-rich trunks of old growth Sitka Spruce in close proximity to coastal shorelines in Alaska and British Columbia. The only verified locality in Canada is in an area with extensive coastal logging, limited buffers, and no formal protection status. Its large size and colour makes it unmistakable.","2024 (25) species",2024,"COSEWIC","COSEWIC - Group 1"
