It reaches its northern limit in the southern Okanagan Valley. Within its Canadian range, it is highly localized and has been recently recorded at only two sites. One is a Haynes Lease Wildlife Area at the north end of Osoyoos Lake and the other is a parcel of crown land on the west side of Osoyoos. While the wildlife area is secure, the crown land is under pressure for annexation and development by the town of Osoyoos. It is currently used for off-road driving and hiking. The species could also occur on the east side of Osoyoos Lake on the Osoyoos Indian Reserve. This would not greatly change the status of the species."

Eremophila alpestris - Horned Lark,Terrestrial,Birds,Eremophila alpestris,Horned Lark,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2020,"Horned Lark is a Holarctic landbird that occurs in Canada's tundra and prairie grasslands, and other open landscapes from seaside barrens to above the alpine tree-line. One of the eight subspecies that occur in Canada, Streaked Horned Lark, was assessed by COSEWIC as Endangered in 2003 and 2018; the other seven are considered here. Horned Lark subspecies differ in range, body size and colouration. Most subspecies have populations estimated at >1 million mature individuals in Canada, but Pallid Horned Lark and Dusky Horned Lark may have only 15,000 to 20,000 mature individuals each. Overall, the Canadian population of Horned Lark is estimated to be about 28 million mature individuals. After apparent increases in the late 1800s, most populations have declined continuously since the 1940s, with loss of marginal agricultural areas and intensification of agriculture in breeding areas, and loss of native grassland habitat negatively affecting populations on both breeding and wintering grounds. Population estimates and trends are difficult to determine for individual subspecies, and appear to vary substantially. However, at the national level, Breeding Bird Survey data for Horned Lark show a long-term (1970-2018) decline of 89% (95% credible interval: -91%, -86%), corresponding to a trend of -4.4% per year (-4.9%, -4.0%), with a short-term (2008-2018) decline of -58% (-64%, -52%), corresponding to an annual trend of -8.4% (-9.7%, -7.0%)."
Erioderma sorediatum - Mouse Ears,Terrestrial,Lichens,Erioderma sorediatum,Mouse Ears,COSEWIC,COSEWIC - Group 1,2022,"Mouse Ears is a rare cyanolichens restricted to coastal forests. In British Columbia, it is found in four subpopulations in 5-10 locations. However some of the occurrences have not been visited for several decades. The small number of locations and the very low density of thalli found at these locations despite substantial search efforts over the last few decades suggest that this species is very rare in coastal British Columbia and could be getting rarer due to threats. In addition, this species lives on ephemeral habitats and are subject to significant threats such as logging, climate warming (heat dome of 2021), and cabin development and other anthropogenic activities along the coast-line. As a result of this information it is recommended that Erioderma sorediatum be seriously considered for an official priority status assessment."

It lives in deciduous woods and open alvar/savannah. Two subpopulations are known: in Petroglyphs Provincial Park (Peterborough County) and Pelee Island (Essex County). The species is probably extremely rare at all sites. Numerous collections (1991-2023) from other places in Ontario have not found this species. Some degree of protection is afforded at both sites; however, the sites are managed with controlled burns which may increase mortality. Habitat degradation due to exotic earthworms and invasive plants, trampling by park visitors and climate change are threats to this species. Rescue from outside Canada is limited due to the Great Lakes acting as barrier and to low dispersal capacity of the snail."

Data from the Breeding Bird Survey for the well-monitored midcontinent population indicate a decline of 42% over the past three generations, with the annual rate of decline accelerating to -4.5% over the past decade. Threats underlying this decline are not well known, although the rapid pace of grassland loss, as well as wetland drainage, are likely key factors. Threats on migration and in overwintering areas include the loss of wetland habitat, collisions with power lines and other infrastructure, human disturbance, contamination (including oil spills), climate-change and sea-level rise."

Most of the global population occurs on Langham Mountain where the full extent of the population is not known. At Tritop Mountain the habitat is restricted to a small area (<2 km2) that has been disturbed by exploration activities in the past and the remaining habitat is subject to shrubification. The Langham subpopulation covers a larger area but is subject to the same threats. Most of the surrounding habitat is forested or covered in shrubs making it unsuitable for this species."

Selasphorus rufus - Rufous Hummingbird,Terrestrial,Birds,Selasphorus rufus,Rufous Hummingbird,COSEWIC,COSEWIC - Group 1,2021,"Rufous Hummingbird remains common throughout its range, with a Canadian population estimate of 12 million mature individuals, comprising 54% of the global total. However, it has experienced a long-term population decline, which has been accelerating recently, with an estimated loss of 31% of the Canadian population between 2009 and 2019. Although causes of the decline remain only partly understood, recent research indicates that pesticides and habitat degradation associated with climate change are increasing threats. As a long-distance migrant, Rufous Hummingbird requires high-quality habitat across multiple areas for breeding, migratory stopovers, and wintering. Consequently, threats are repeatedly encountered over their annual life cycle, increasing their cumulative impact on populations."

Spilogale gracilis - Western Spotted Skunk,Terrestrial,Mammals (terrestrial),Spilogale gracilis,Western Spotted Skunk,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2022,"Western Spotted Skunk in Canada is only found in the southwestern corner of British Columbia. The species is thought to be a habitat generalist, but in BC is found predominantly across deciduous and coniferous forest, riparian areas, and agricultural lands. Although the species is historically rare in Canada, anecdotal fur-trapping records suggest that the species was more common in southwestern BC during the 1950s and 1960s. A number of recent camera-trap studies from across the historical distribution in Canada suggest that the species is now very rare, being found only infrequently. The major threat is habitat loss associated with residential development. Trapping and road mortality could be continuing threats."
