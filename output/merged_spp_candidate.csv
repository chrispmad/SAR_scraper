Adults fly from May to July, there is one generation per season and the larvae feed on blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) or other grasses. The species is known from eight sites: Lethbridge (AB), Writing-on-stone Provincial Park (AB), Taber (AB), North Pinhorn Grazing Preserve (AB), Estuary (SK), Val Marie (SK), Deer Forks (SK) and Roche Percee (SK). Widespread habitat conversion during the early 1900s and the loss of Plains Bison contributed to the loss of prairie grassland habitat suitable for this species. Current threats include agricultural intensification, habitat fragmentation and lack of connectivity between natural grassland fragments, invasive plants that change soil chemistry and/or outcompete native larval and nectar host plants, and roadside/agricultural pesticide use. There are currently no Canadian records on iNaturalist, BugGuide or other citizen science/online forums."

Cystophora cristata - Hooded Seal,Aquatic,Mammals (marine),Cystophora cristata,Hooded Seal,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2024,"The Hooded Seal is distributed over continental shelf break areas of the North Atlantic; in summer their range extends into Arctic waters. A single population is recognized, but has been divided into two management stocks, based on the location of the whelping areas-the NE and N Atlantic stocks. The NW Atlantic stock accounts for 85% of the population but only spends approximately half the year in Canadian waters. The NW Atlantic stock has not been assessed since 2006, when it was estimated at 600,000 animals. The NE Atlantic stock was assessed in 2017 at 80,000 animals. Herds in all areas are thought to be declining. The NE Atlantic stock appears to be declining at a rate of 1-2% per year. Hooded Seals are harvested for subsistence in Greenland. Adults can be hunted commercially in the NW Atlantic, but few if any animals are taken. Declines in quality and quantity of the seasonal pack ice which are essential for breeding and changes in food resources are thought to be impacting this species. The outlook under climate change is for continued deterioration in ice cover, which will negatively impact this species, because they have shown no signs of using terrestrial sites for hauling out or pupping. Over the longer term there may be a northward shift in distribution of pupping and molting areas as the ice contracts northwards, but this may also lead to increased natural mortality if it results in increased overlap with an important predator Polar Bear. This species was last assessed as not at risk by COSEWIC in 1986."

One of the eight subspecies that occur in Canada, Streaked Horned Lark, was assessed by COSEWIC as Endangered in 2003 and 2018; the other seven are considered here. Horned Lark subspecies differ in range, body size and colouration. Most subspecies have populations estimated at >1 million mature individuals in Canada, but Pallid Horned Lark and Dusky Horned Lark may have only 15,000 to 20,000 mature individuals each. Overall, the Canadian population of Horned Lark is estimated to be about 28 million mature individuals. After apparent increases in the late 1800s, most populations have declined continuously since the 1940s, with loss of marginal agricultural areas and intensification of agriculture in breeding areas, and loss of native grassland habitat negatively affecting populations on both breeding and wintering grounds. Population estimates and trends are difficult to determine for individual subspecies, and appear to vary substantially. However, at the national level, Breeding Bird Survey data for Horned Lark show a long-term (1970-2018) decline of 89% (95% credible interval: -91%, -86%), corresponding to a trend of -4.4% per year (-4.9%, -4.0%), with a short-term (2008-2018) decline of -58% (-64%, -52%), corresponding to an annual trend of -8.4% (-9.7%, -7.0%)."

In British Columbia, it is found in four subpopulations in 5-10 locations. However some of the occurrences have not been visited for several decades. The small number of locations and the very low density of thalli found at these locations despite substantial search efforts over the last few decades suggest that this species is very rare in coastal British Columbia and could be getting rarer due to threats. In addition, this species lives on ephemeral habitats and are subject to significant threats such as logging, climate warming (heat dome of 2021), and cabin development and other anthropogenic activities along the coast-line. As a result of this information it is recommended that Erioderma sorediatum be seriously considered for an official priority status assessment."

An estimated 95% of these communities have been lost due to fire suppression, conversion of land to agricultural production, and other development (residential/industrial/transportation). As a slow-growing, late successional and long-lived species, plains rough fescue is threatened by aggressive invasive species, particularly perennial, rhizomatous grasses, which readily establish on the rich soils of the fescue grasslands. Furthermore, climate change is expected to bring warmer, drier conditions to the Canadian prairies, pushing the climatic envelope of plains rough fescue well to the north."

It is only known from two locations in southern Ontario and appears to be extremely local in its distribution. Other suitable habitats have been well surveyed, and the species has gone undetected, although this species would benefit from additional targeted search effort in a few key habitats. Habitat succession, invasive species and recreational use of habitats are a current and ongoing threat."

Adults fly from June to July, with one generation per season in Canada and larvae feed on blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with fluff grass (Erioneuron pulchellum) also reported as a host plant in other parts of its US range. Records are from 1928 to 2009 from five sites including Surprise Valley (SK), Rosefield (SK), Minton (1928, SK), Grasslands National Park (SK) and Miniota (MB). Widespread habitat conversion during the early 1900's and the loss of Plains Bison contributed to the loss of prairie grassland habitat suitable for this species. Current threats include agricultural intensification, habitat fragmentation and lack of connectivity between natural grassland fragments, invasive plants that change and/or outcompete native larval and nectar host plants, and roadside/agricultural pesticide use.

Data from the Breeding Bird Survey for the well-monitored midcontinent population indicate a decline of 42% over the past three generations, with the annual rate of decline accelerating to -4.5% over the past decade. Threats underlying this decline are not well known, although the rapid pace of grassland loss, as well as wetland drainage, are likely key factors. Threats on migration and in overwintering areas include the loss of wetland habitat, collisions with power lines and other infrastructure, human disturbance, contamination (including oil spills), climate-change and sea-level rise."

Some degree of protection is afforded at both sites; however, the sites are managed with controlled burns which may increase mortality. Habitat degradation due to exotic earthworms and invasive plants, trampling by park visitors and climate change are threats to this species. Rescue from outside Canada is limited due to the Great Lakes acting as barrier and to low dispersal capacity of the snail."

The larvae feed on the foliage of biscuitroots and perhaps other members of the carrot family that grow on sunny, south facing subalpine slopes. The species' extremely small range makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as wildfires, which are predicted to increase in size and intensity with climate change. The warming climate may also cause some loss of open subalpine meadows through an increase in tree and shrub cover."

Phoca groenlandica - Harp Seal,Aquatic,Mammals (marine),Phoca groenlandica,Harp Seal,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2024,"Harp Seal is distributed over continental shelf areas of the North Atlantic; in summer their range extends into Arctic waters. Three populations are recognized, but only the Northwest Atlantic population, which accounts for 76% of the world population occurs in Canadian waters. All populations recovered after implementation of conservation measures in the 1970s, but all have shown declines over the last 20-50 years. Harp Seals are harvested commercially and for subsistence, but current harvests are well below sustainable levels. Declines in quality and quantity of the seasonal pack ice which are essential for breeding and changes in food resources are thought to be impacting this species. The outlook under climate change is for continued deterioration in ice cover, which will negatively impact this species, because they have shown no signs of using terrestrial sites for hauling out or pupping. Over the longer term there may be a northward shift in distribution of pupping and molting areas as the ice contracts northwards, but this may also lead to increased natural mortality if it results in increased overlap with an important predator, Polar Bear. This species has never been assessed by COSEWIC."

Once thought to be extinct, 8 pairs were found nesting on the Castle Harbour islands in Bermuda in 1951. Numbers have increased to 134 pairs in 2020, in response to intensive conservation and management efforts, with about 80% now nesting in artificial burrows. Recent telemetry tracking studies have shown that Bermuda Petrel regularly forages over deep waters within the Canadian 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone southeast of Nova Scotia, during incubation and chick-rearing periods in April and May. Significant threats at the Bermudan breeding colonies include competition with native White-tailed Tropicbird for nest sites, effects of pesticides, and predation by introduced rats. The primary threat is posed by increasing frequency and intensity of fall storms that periodically inundate colonies and destroy low-lying nest sites, exacerbated by ongoing sea level rise. Threats at sea are poorly known, but likely include lighting on ships and structures, offshore wind power development, and climate-related range shifts in prey species."

However, it has experienced a long-term population decline, which has been accelerating recently, with an estimated loss of 31% of the Canadian population between 2009 and 2019. Although causes of the decline remain only partly understood, recent research indicates that pesticides and habitat degradation associated with climate change are increasing threats. As a long-distance migrant, Rufous Hummingbird requires high-quality habitat across multiple areas for breeding, migratory stopovers, and wintering. Consequently, threats are repeatedly encountered over their annual life cycle, increasing their cumulative impact on populations."

Historically, the species was presumably widespread in native grasslands throughout the Canadian prairies. These habitats have experienced up to 77% loss throughout the 20th century, mostly due to conversion to agriculture. Loss of grasslands continues, primarily due to fire suppression and grazing regimes that allow vegetation succession to proceed. The species is vulnerable to prolonged summer droughts because it breeds in shallow pools that are subject to drying, leading to periodic failures to produce surviving young. While the species is adapted to predictably variable arid environments, disruption of climatic patterns, combined with intensive agriculture and road networks that constrain dispersal, is likely to result in population declines."

Tringa melanoleuca - Greater Yellowlegs,Terrestrial,Birds,Tringa melanoleuca,Greater Yellowlegs,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2024,"Greater Yellowlegs is a familiar shorebird that breeds in bogs across Canada's boreal zone, and winters from the southern coasts of the United States southward, including the Caribbean and South America. Although still relatively common, recent analyses of standardized shorebird surveys show that Greater Yellowlegs has likely declined by 43% over the past three generations (15 years). This species' wide range and long migration exposes it to a wide variety of threats across many countries. It is unclear which threats account for the species' decline, but they likely include hunting through much of the winter range, and wetland habitat loss and degradation throughout the migration and winter range."
Tringa solitaria - Solitary Sandpiper,Terrestrial,Birds,Tringa solitaria,Solitary Sandpiper,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2024,"Solitary Sandpiper is a widespread but poorly-studied shorebird that nests in coniferous trees throughout the boreal zone of Canada, and winters from the Caribbean and Central America through most of South America. Although still relatively common, recent analyses of standardized shorebird surveys show that this species has likely declined by 50% over the past ten years. Its wide range and long migrations expose it to a wide variety of threats across many countries. While it is unclear exactly which threats account for the species' decline, loss and degradation of freshwater wetland habitat, particularly on the migration and wintering grounds, are likely important, as is hunting on the migration and winter range."

Ventridens suppressus - Flat Dome,Terrestrial,Molluscs,Ventridens suppressus,Flat Dome,SSC,SSC - Group 1,2024,"This is a medium-size, but distinctive species. The about 100 years old records are from the Hamilton area. Despite large search effort the species hasn't been found in southern Ontario. This species lives in mesic, rocky upland woods. It is possible that Niagara Escarpment has suitable habitat for this species that still needs to be searched. If the species is still extant in Canada, all threats that reduce habitat quantity and quality are possible, with severity being up to extreme. Threats also include climate change, trampling, and invasive species."
Xanthaptychia aurantiaca - Arctic Orangebush Lichen,Terrestrial,Lichens,Xanthaptychia aurantiaca,Arctic Orangebush Lichen,COSEWIC,COSEWIC - Group 1,2020,"Xanthaptychia aurantiaca is narrowly restricted to western portions of the Canadian Arctic. It is a relatively large bright orange macrolichen that is conspicuous on the landscape. However, there are only 14 known collections. The region has been thoroughly surveyed for lichens (see map under Search Effort), with over 6600 lichens collections known. This suggests that X. aurantiaca is not only narrowly endemic, but also rare within its range. All collections are coastal. Most collections have been made on Banks Island and the Parry Peninsula in the Northwest Territories. This species is threatened by a loss of habitat from rapidly eroding coasts, saline wash resulting from storm surges, and permafrost melting. These threats are due to a reduction in sea ice cover on the Beaufort Sea and changes in weather patterns caused by on-going climate change."
