It reaches its northern limit in the southern Okanagan Valley. Within its Canadian range, it is highly localized and has been recently recorded at only two sites. One is a Haynes Lease Wildlife Area at the north end of Osoyoos Lake and the other is a parcel of crown land on the west side of Osoyoos. While the wildlife area is secure, the crown land is under pressure for annexation and development by the town of Osoyoos. It is currently used for off-road driving and hiking. The species could also occur on the east side of Osoyoos Lake on the Osoyoos Indian Reserve. This would not greatly change the status of the species.",2019 (1) species
1,Arctic Orangebush Lichen,Lichens,Xanthaptychia aurantiaca,"Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Northwest Territories, Parks Canada Agency",2023,"Xanthaptychia aurantiaca is narrowly restricted to western portions of the Canadian Arctic. It is a relatively large bright orange macrolichen that is conspicuous on the landscape. However, there are only 14 known collections. The region has been thoroughly surveyed for lichens (see map under Search Effort), with over 6600 lichens collections known. This suggests that X. aurantiaca is not only narrowly endemic, but also rare within its range. All collections are coastal. Most collections have been made on Banks Island and the Parry Peninsula in the Northwest Territories. This species is threatened by a loss of habitat from rapidly eroding coasts, saline wash resulting from storm surges, and permafrost melting. These threats are due to a reduction in sea ice cover on the Beaufort Sea and changes in weather patterns caused by on-going climate change.",2020 (7) species

One of the eight subspecies that occur in Canada, Streaked Horned Lark, was assessed by COSEWIC as Endangered in 2003 and 2018; the other seven are considered here. Horned Lark subspecies differ in range, body size and colouration. Most subspecies have populations estimated at >1 million mature individuals in Canada, but Pallid Horned Lark and Dusky Horned Lark may have only 15,000 to 20,000 mature individuals each. Overall, the Canadian population of Horned Lark is estimated to be about 28 million mature individuals. After apparent increases in the late 1800s, most populations have declined continuously since the 1940s, with loss of marginal agricultural areas and intensification of agriculture in breeding areas, and loss of native grassland habitat negatively affecting populations on both breeding and wintering grounds. Population estimates and trends are difficult to determine for individual subspecies, and appear to vary substantially. However, at the national level, Breeding Bird Survey data for Horned Lark show a long-term (1970-2018) decline of 89% (95% credible interval: -91%, -86%), corresponding to a trend of -4.4% per year (-4.9%, -4.0%), with a short-term (2008-2018) decline of -58% (-64%, -52%), corresponding to an annual trend of -8.4% (-9.7%, -7.0%).",2020 (7) species

Once thought to be extinct, 8 pairs were found nesting on the Castle Harbour islands in Bermuda in 1951. Numbers have increased to 134 pairs in 2020, in response to intensive conservation and management efforts, with about 80% now nesting in artificial burrows. Recent telemetry tracking studies have shown that Bermuda Petrel regularly forages over deep waters within the Canadian 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone southeast of Nova Scotia, during incubation and chick-rearing periods in April and May. Significant threats at the Bermudan breeding colonies include competition with native White-tailed Tropicbird for nest sites, effects of pesticides, and predation by introduced rats. The primary threat is posed by increasing frequency and intensity of fall storms that periodically inundate colonies and destroy low-lying nest sites, exacerbated by ongoing sea level rise. Threats at sea are poorly known, but likely include lighting on ships and structures, offshore wind power development, and climate-related range shifts in prey species.",2021 (5) species

11,Plains Spadefoot,Amphibians,Spea bombifrons,"Alberta, Canadian Wildlife Service, Manitoba, Parks Canada Agency, Saskatchewan",2023,"Plains Spadefoot has patchy distribution throughout the dry interior of North America, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Historically, the species was presumably widespread in native grasslands throughout the Canadian prairies. These habitats have experienced up to 77% loss throughout the 20th century, mostly due to conversion to agriculture. Loss of grasslands continues, primarily due to fire suppression and grazing regimes that allow vegetation succession to proceed. The species is vulnerable to prolonged summer droughts because it breeds in shallow pools that are subject to drying, leading to periodic failures to produce surviving young. While the species is adapted to predictably variable arid environments, disruption of climatic patterns, combined with intensive agriculture and road networks that constrain dispersal, is likely to result in population declines.",2021 (5) species

Of these, only one has been recently verified; the others have not been relocated, and at least one is considered extirpated. The species has probably declined from historical populations since many of them are associated with wetland habitat that now occurs in highly modified landscapes. Two new sites have been discovered in recent years resulting in a total of three extant subpopulations, though the total number of mature individuals is not known. The habitat at the largest site is rapidly declining due to the spread of the invasive, introduced European Reed, an aggressive exotic wetland grass.",2024 (25) species
38,Tall Green Milkweed,Vascular plants,Asclepias hirtella,"Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Ontario, Parks Canada Agency",,"This large milkweed is restricted in Canada to tallgrass prairie remnants in Windsor, Ontario. There are only a few extant subpopulations and less than 40 plants probably remain. Potential threats include transportation and utility corridors, invasive species and other ecosystem modifications such as drainage and mowing.",2024 (25) species
39,Tiger Mydas Fly,Arthropods,Nemomydas pantherinus,"British Columbia, Canadian Wildlife Service, Parks Canada Agency",,"The Tiger Mydas Fly is a distinctive, predaceous fly that is restricted to the Okanagan, Similkameen and Kettle Valleys in Canada, where it occurs in the hottest, driest grassland-steppe plant communities. The area of this habitat continues to decline at about 2% annually.",2024 (25) species
40,Tinted Woodland Spurge,Vascular plants,Euphorbia commutata,"Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Ontario, Parks Canada Agency",,"This small, annual plant is restricted in Canada to marble barrens near Black Donald Lake in Renfrew County and limestone alvars in Hastings County in eastern Ontario. There are about 13 documented subpopulations, of which 11 are considered extant. Threats include residential and commercial development, forestry activities, and invasive species.",2024 (25) species
41,Velvet Wedge,Molluscs,Xolotrema denotatum,"Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Ontario, Parks Canada Agency",,"Velvet Wedge might be a rare species at the northern limit of its range in southern Ontario and Quebec. This species is usually found on the Niagara Escarpment, but also in lowland forest. Some of the historical occurrence sites have already been lost through habitat loss and degradation. Other threats might be invasive species, climate change, and anthropogenic pressure.",2024 (25) species
42,Yellow Globelet,Molluscs,Mesodon clausus,"Canadian Museum of Nature, Canadian Wildlife Service, Ontario, Parks Canada Agency",,"Yellow Globelet (Mesodon clausus) is a rare land snail at the northern limit of its range in southern Ontario. It lives in deciduous woods and open alvar/savannah. Two subpopulations are known: in Petroglyphs Provincial Park (Peterborough County) and Pelee Island (Essex County). The species is probably extremely rare at all sites. Numerous collections (1991-2023) from other places in Ontario have not found this species. Some degree of protection is afforded at both sites; however, the sites are managed with controlled burns which may increase mortality. Habitat degradation due to exotic earthworms and invasive plants, trampling by park visitors and climate change are threats to this species. Rescue from outside Canada is limited due to the Great Lakes acting as barrier and to low dispersal capacity of the snail.",2024 (25) species
